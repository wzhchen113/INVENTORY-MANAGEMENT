-- ============================================================
-- Spec 021 — Reorder / delivery list (v1)
--
-- Adds `report_reorder_list(uuid, jsonb)` — a per-vendor "what to
-- order" payload joining inventory_items + vendors + order_schedule
-- + the latest EOD submission per vendor + a usage-forecast subquery.
-- Mirrors the security shape of the reports trilogy (cogs / variance)
-- but is intentionally NOT registered as a report template — there is
-- no persisted-run history. The frontend calls this RPC directly and
-- caches the latest payload in a Zustand slice per spec design §9.
--
-- ─── v1 scope (per Backend Architecture §0) ─────────────────
--
-- • `pending_po_qty` is RETURNED in the payload but is ALWAYS 0 in v1.
--   The spec's A3 PO-subtraction cannot be implemented as written —
--   the live `purchase_orders.status` lifecycle has no coded
--   "in flight" state, and `po_items` is NEVER written by the live
--   app (`db.createPurchaseOrder` writes only the header). The UI
--   breakdown line "on hand: X | inbound: 0 | par: Z → order: N" is
--   contract-stable for v2 once the PO write path lands. v2 swaps in
--   a real CTE; the payload shape is unchanged.
--
-- • `purchase_orders.status` lifecycle uncertainty. The schema comment
--   on `purchase_orders.status` (`'draft' | 'sent' | 'received' |
--   'partial'`) does NOT match what the live app writes
--   (`db.createPurchaseOrder` hardcodes `'submitted'`). When the PO
--   flow gains a real lifecycle, the v2 swap should filter on
--   `status IN ('submitted','sent','partial') AND received_at IS NULL`
--   — the receipt gate works regardless of which status string is in
--   use. See spec 021 §1 for the full audit.
--
-- • "Create PO" button is disabled in v1 — `db.createPurchaseOrder`
--   would persist a zero-line PO that downstream variance / receiving
--   flows can't reconcile. Deferred to a follow-up spec.
--
-- ─── EOD-first / current_stock fallback (A1) ──────────────────
--
-- Post-spec-020, `eod_submissions(store_id, date, vendor_id)` is
-- unique — so per (store, as_of_date, vendor) there's AT MOST one
-- submission. If that submission exists and is `status='submitted'`,
-- on_hand for items in that vendor pulls from the submission's
-- eod_entries.actual_remaining (when non-null). The vendor's
-- `on_hand_source` is `'eod'` if ANY EOD submission exists today for
-- that vendor; per-item missing-entry fallback still uses
-- `inventory_items.current_stock` but the vendor badge stays `'eod'`
-- with a per-item `'eod_missing_for_item'` flag.
--
-- ─── Hybrid formula (A2) ─────────────────────────────────────
--
-- suggested_qty = max(par_replacement, usage_forecasted)
--   par_replacement  = max(0, par_level - on_hand - pending_po_qty)
--   usage_forecasted = max(0,
--                          usage_per_portion
--                        * average_portions_per_day
--                        * days_until_next_delivery
--                        - on_hand - pending_po_qty)
--
-- Usage forecast degrades to 0 when:
--   • inventory_items.usage_per_portion is NULL or 0, OR
--   • the item is not in any recipe (no portions/day signal), OR
--   • there are no pos_imports in the trailing 7d window.
-- In those cases par_replacement carries the suggestion; max() picks
-- whichever is larger. Items with both par_level=0/NULL AND
-- usage_forecast=0 produce suggested_qty=0 and are filtered out at
-- the row grain — matching the spec's "hide vendor with zero
-- suggested items" AC.
--
-- ─── Next-delivery math (§6) ─────────────────────────────────
--
-- order_schedule(store_id, day_of_week, vendor_id, delivery_day) —
-- delivery_day is what we want here (when the truck arrives), not
-- day_of_week (when the order goes out). For each vendor we take the
-- MINIMUM days_offset across all delivery_days for that vendor in
-- this store.
--
-- Edge cases:
--   1. delivery_day == today's DOW and vendors.order_cutoff_time has
--      already passed → force days_offset = 7 (next cycle). If cutoff
--      is NULL or not yet passed, days_offset = 0 (truck arrives
--      today, fold today's needs in).
--   2. No order_schedule rows for vendor → A5: 7-day default,
--      schedule_known=false, next_delivery_date = as_of_date + 7.
--      _warnings entry surfaced.
--   3. Multiple delivery_days per vendor → MIN distance picks the
--      nearest. Correct intent (per spec §6 case 3).
--
-- ─── Item name source ────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- inventory_items.name was dropped in P3 lockdown
-- (`20260504072830_brand_catalog_p3_lockdown.sql:59`). Names live on
-- catalog_ingredients.name now. Mirrors the variance runner.
--
-- ─── Auth + grants ───────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- security invoker — every SELECT inside the function runs as the
-- calling user, so RLS gates each read. The auth_can_see_store()
-- pre-flight is defence-in-depth + clean 42501 rejection for the
-- foreign-store case.
